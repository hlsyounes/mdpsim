* Added partial observability. See README for the additions to PDDL.

Version 2.2.3 (Jan 22, 2008)

* Added "light-com" protocol, which transmits only state changes
  between time step t and t+1. See details of the protocol in README.
  Tested with mdpclient, mtbddclient and FPG (option "-l" in all three
  cases).

* Fixed memory leak in strxml.cc (r23).

Version 2.2.2 (Nov 2, 2007)

* Added newline character to state message (was removed in version
  2.0---should not be needed, but it seems that some clients rely on it being
  present, so it was added for backward compatibility).

* Set TCP_NODELAY to optimize socket communication for small messages.

* Updated protocol description in README to match implementation.

* Fixed problem with lost server messages at the end of a session.

* Simplified configuration of CUDDDIR (no need to place library files in a
  single directory anymore---CUDDDIR can just be set of base directory of cudd
  package).  Also fixed compilation of mtbddclient on Cygwin.

Version 2.2.1 (Oct 13, 2007)

* Fixed configuration issues on Mac reported by Daniel Borrajo.

Version 2.2 (Oct 9, 2007)
